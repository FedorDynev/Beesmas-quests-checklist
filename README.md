Quest planner for Beesmas NPC quests in Bee Swarm Simulator

This repository contains a Google Sheets checklist for NPC quests in Bee Swarm Simulator, focused mainly on the Beesmas event.

The main purpose of this spreadsheet is to make quest completion more comfortable and efficient. In Beesmas, many NPC quests share the same mechanics, but if you complete quests one by one, progress is often slow because overlapping mechanics are not completed in parallel. This table reorganizes quests by mechanics so players can plan their gameplay better and finish multiple quests at the same time.

The spreadsheet is structured around a Master sheet and multiple mechanic-based sheets. The Master sheet contains a full list of NPC quests with their general requirements so each quest can be understood as a whole. From there, quests are linked to sheets dedicated to specific mechanics, where you can see all NPCs and quests that rely on the same mechanic. This makes it easier to decide what to focus on during a farming session.

Detailed numeric requirements are kept minimal inside the table to avoid clutter. When necessary, "Quests sheet", external wiki or fandom pages can be used alongside the spreadsheet for exact values and explanations. The goal of this project is not to replace the wiki, but to act as a planning and optimization tool.

The spreadsheet is made in Google Sheets so it works on both PC and mobile devices. It can also be downloaded and used locally if needed. Anyone can make a personal copy and adjust it for their own progress.

Feedback is welcome. If you notice missing quests, incorrect mechanics, or have ideas for improving the structure, you can leave feedback through GitHub Issues. This helps keep the project clean and useful for everyone.
